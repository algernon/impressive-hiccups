# impressive-hiccups

This is a small collection of functions and macros that can help
writing [impress.js][impress-js] presentations. The core of it, the
`slide` and `group` functions have been lifted from [Misaki][misaki],
with very little change.

 [impress-js]: http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js
 [misaki]: http://liquidz.github.com/misaki/

## Demo

Presentations made with the library are available under the
[impressions][impressions] repository.
